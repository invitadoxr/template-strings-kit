### Limitations
Malformed elements may _break your syntax highlighting_.
This issue _is common in many highlighters_ 
that handle embedded languages (but silently omitted) , 
such as styled components, lit elements, etc.
While it‚Äôs unlikely that this is intentional, 
you can prevent these issues by 
using comments in the embedded language, e.g : 

| embedded language  | comment        |
| -                  | -              |
| html               | `` <!-- --> `` |
| css                | `` // }     `` |
| jsx                | `` // </>   `` |

or by using JavaScript comments, e.g. : 

| embedded language  | comment        |
| -                  | -              |
| html               | `` // >`   ``  |
| css                | `` // }`   ``  |
| jsx                | `` // </>` ``  |

These are just examples, situations may vary.
You will practically never have to think about this, but it is still better to know. Just write clean code and you will be fine.
